# Product-Data-Scientist-Interview-Questions
Repository spanning resources to prepare for Data Scientist, Product Analytics roles at FAANG companies.

If you are interested for a core technical Data Science role, geared primarily towards Modelling and Engineering, I suggest you check out my other repository [Data Science Interview Resources](https://github.com/rbhatia46/Data-Science-Interview-Resources), which I have created specifically for this purpose, this repo primarily focuses on Product based Data Science roles, usually found at Big Tech companies like FAANG, though both sound very similar but there is a huge difference in preparing for a General DS role vs preparing for a Product DS role, so use the suitable resources as per requirement.

* Primarily, any Product DS Interview has multiple components to it, from testing your **technical knowledge** to **understanding your product sense**, and testing **additional soft skills** required for the role.

* When it comes to evaluating your Product Sense, you will primarily face 3 categories of questions -
1. Product Improvement
2. Success Metrics
3. Product Testing

I will try to list some valuable resources corresponding to each - 

## Product Improvement
